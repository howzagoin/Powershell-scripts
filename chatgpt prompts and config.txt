Here are the features that will be included in all future scripts, formatted for clarity:

Features to Include in Every Future Script:
Script Comments at the Top:

Author: Tim MacLatchy
Date: Date of script creation or modification
License: A brief MIT license
Description: A concise description of the scriptâ€™s purpose

Check if any required modules are missing at the start of the script, and install them if necessary.

Use a web-based login with MFA. Once logged in, the session should be reused throughout the script without needing additional authentication. If a login fails, output a clear explanation.

Handle errors gracefully, providing clear and detailed error messages, especially when login fails. Ensure the console output is never incomplete due to an error.

Provide detailed verbose logging and output at every step, so you can track each action in the console.

Display progress bars for operations that take time, such as querying large datasets or processing multiple items.

If saving output as Excel spreadsheet, prompt for the file location and name using a pop-up.

Automatically adjust column widths when exporting data to Excel to ensure proper formatting and readability.

Output files should be named based on the tenant name, the date, and the operation performed (e.g., tenantname_date_searchtype.xlsx).

Ensure that Excel headers are searchable for easy filtering and sorting.

Use delimiters (${}) around variable references inside strings to avoid parser errors.

Include specific error handling for cmdlets (e.g., Write-Progress, Process-Site) to ensure the script runs without crashing and reports errors clearly.

Always output the updated whole script, not just the updated part.

Date format order should be date, month, year
